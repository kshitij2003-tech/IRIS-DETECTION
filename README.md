ðŸš€ Built an AI-Powered Iris Flower Classification App! ðŸŒ¸ðŸ¤–

Excited to share my latest project: Iris Flower Classification Using Neural Networks! This AI-powered application classifies iris flowers based on petal and sepal measurements using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and an interactive Gradio UI.

âœ¨ What I Built:
âœ… Loaded and visualized the Iris dataset
âœ… Developed an ANN model with TensorFlow & Keras
âœ… Trained the model for accurate flower classification
âœ… Created a stylish, user-friendly Gradio UI
âœ… Deployed the app with a shareable link

ðŸ›  Tech Stack: Python | TensorFlow | Keras | Gradio | Deep Learning

ðŸ’¡ Key Learnings & Challenges:
This project helped me gain deeper insights into neural networks, dataset preprocessing, and deploying AI models with an interactive UI. Fine-tuning the model to achieve better accuracy was an exciting challenge!
